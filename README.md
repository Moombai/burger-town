## Burger Town

Burger town is a single page React application bootstrapped with Facebook's wonderful `create-react-app` toolkit. The application itself shows a number of burger eateries placed on a map and displays further information when the map markers have been clicked. This project demonstrates responsive features in React, integration with third party APIâ€™s such as Google Maps (without using library), management of asynchronous data, semantic HTML and accessibility.

### Dependencies
- The project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Location data has been retrieved using the [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)

### Running this project
- Navigate to the directory where you intend to run this app
- Clone the repository
- Install the project dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the development server with `npm start`

### Deployment to production
This application can be ejected from the create-react-app environment and deployed to production. This comes with the added benefit of Service Worker Scripts that will cache pages for offline use.

To deploy to production:
- Build for production using `npm run build`
- Navigate to the build directory and run the application with the server of your choice
